# HzRG-Candidates-from-the-MGCLS

This repository is dedicated to the High-Redshift Radio Galaxy (HzRG) catalogues derived from the MeerKAT Galaxy Cluster Legacy Survey (MGCLS).

## Overview
High-Redshift Radio Galaxies are fundamental in understanding the early universe, serving as markers for massive galaxy formation and large-scale structure. The MGCLS offers deep radio observations across multiple galaxy clusters in the suthern sky, presenting an excellent opportunity to identify HzRG candidates.

## Available Catalogues
A comprehensive list of 2249 HzRG candidates identified using 1.28 GHz data. These candidates were selected based on non-detections in all-sky optical and infrared catalogues, combined with ultra-steep spectrum criteria (spectral index Î± < -1).

Our seach includes the following HzRG candidate catalogues:
* Abell 22
* Abell 2744
* Abell 2751
